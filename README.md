# noteTaker
Note taker 

## Description
My motivation for this project was to test my new skills in express with backend functions. I built this project to create an app for note taking. This solved the problem of needing a pen and paper to write down notes all the time.  I learned that heroku can be hard to work with, still in the process of getting it to actually deploy correctly...
